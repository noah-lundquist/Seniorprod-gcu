# Seniorprod-gcu

This is my senior project for my Bachelor's in Software Engineering. This is a online store web application that has opportunity for future developments to advance it further.
Right now the project when a product is clicked forwards to the contact form. I developed it this way because our current website functions similar. The reason being is we have a lot of 
local clients and that is how we handle shipping, or delivering orders to people. 

This project is built with asp.net and bootstrap css. Utilizing this tech stack allows for future developments to be easier. Including adding in a checkout component, with a database component as well as an admin portal.

To install and run the project just download the repo to visual studio code and hit run. This will launch the project in the edge browser. 

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement". Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!
